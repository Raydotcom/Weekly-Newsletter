# Weekly Market Letters  
A recurring series of one-page macro & market summaries.  
Each weekly letter analyzes:

1. **What moved markets**  
2. **How major asset classes reacted**  
3. **Why it matters for the week ahead**  
4. **One article of the week** 

This repository aims to:
- Build analytical discipline  
- Develop a macro narrative week after week  
- Demonstrate market awareness  
- Provide a real sample of research-style writing  
- Serve as a public portfolio for internships and recruiters
