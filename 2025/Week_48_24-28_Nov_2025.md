## 1. What Moved Markets This Week

### **1. Black Friday becomes a key test for the strength of the U.S. consumer**
Markets focused heavily on early holiday spending indicators as consumer sentiment weakened and several economic releases remained unavailable due to the recent U.S. government shutdown. With household spending representing over two-thirds of U.S. GDP, investors treated Black Friday and Cyber Monday as critical measures of consumer resilience.

### **2. Nvidia’s strong results fail to lift tech as AI valuation concerns rise**
Despite another solid quarter from Nvidia, mega-cap tech remained volatile. Investors increasingly questioned how quickly multi-billion-dollar AI infrastructure investments will translate into actual profits, weighing on the broader semiconductor and cloud ecosystem.

### **3. Mixed labor data and persistent inflation keep markets uncertain ahead of the December Fed meeting**
The latest jobs data delivered conflicting signals — accelerating job growth but a four-year-high in unemployment. Combined with sticky inflation, this kept markets unsure about the likelihood and timing of a Fed rate cut in December.

### **Equities**

- **Nasdaq: +5.83%** — tech-led strength, though AI-linked volatility persisted.

- **German Bund 10Y:** broadly stable for the week.

### **FX**
- **EUR/USD: +0.81%** — supported by a softer USD and Fed repricing.  
- **DXY: –0.72%** — risk-on flows and lower safe-haven demand.

### **Commodities**
- **Brent: –1.58%** — demand concerns and uncertainty over consumer strength.  
- **Gold: +4.89%** — strong inflows amid policy uncertainty and risk hedging.

## 3. Why It Matters for Next Week (1–5 December)

### **1. AI profitability stays the dominant catalyst**
With markets questioning how quickly AI spending can turn into profits, investors will scrutinize any new developments involving Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta, and cloud-infrastructure companies. Additional doubts could pressure the sector into December.

### **2. Risk appetite appears fragile — Bitcoin acting as an early warning signal**
Bitcoin’s steep fall from above $125k to below $90k may signal deteriorating risk appetite. Further pressure on speculative assets could spill over into equities, especially high-valuation tech.

### **3. Key U.S. economic data (manufacturing, services, sentiment) may shift the macro narrative**
Data delayed by the government shutdown will begin to arrive. Any surprise in manufacturing, service activity, or consumer sentiment could quickly move rates and equities.

### **4. Earnings from Salesforce, Kroger, and Dollar Tree will test both corporate and consumer strength**
Cloud earnings will indicate the state of enterprise IT spending, while major retailers will help gauge whether households remain resilient entering the year-end season.

### **5. Fed expectations for the December 9–10 meeting will set the tone**
Rate-cut odds have risen above 80%. Confirmation of easing could broaden the rally beyond mega-cap tech. A reversal would likely trigger volatility across risk assets.
