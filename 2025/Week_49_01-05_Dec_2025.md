**Week of 1–5 December 2025**

## 1. What Moved Markets This Week

### **1. Powell’s recent caution and mixed economic data kept volatility elevated**
Investor sentiment remained fragile as markets continued to digest Chair Powell’s earlier warning that a December rate cut was “not a foregone conclusion.” Although PCE inflation matched expectations and consumer sentiment improved, jobless claims fell to their lowest level in more than three years — a sign of labor-market resilience. At the same time, key employment data remained delayed due to the government shutdown, leaving markets without a complete macro picture and increasing sensitivity across equities and Treasuries.

### **2. Markets priced in an 84% chance of a rate cut, but doubts about a surprise hold grew**
Futures markets ended the week assigning an 84% probability to a 25bp cut next Wednesday, supporting a modest risk-on tone. But several economists warned that investors may be underestimating the risk of no cut, particularly given Powell’s cautious stance and the FOMC’s internal split. As a result, markets shifted their attention from whether the Fed cuts to how divided the vote will be and what Powell signals about policy in early 2026.

### **3. Bitcoin’s unusual divergence from equities kept crypto firmly on the market watchlist**
Bitcoin remained a key focus this week as it continued to decouple from its historical correlation with stocks. While the S&P 500 is up more than 16% year-to-date, bitcoin is firmly in negative territory — its first major directional divergence from equities since 2014. Despite still acting at times as a risk-on asset, bitcoin has traded in a broad range between $75,000 and $120,000 this year, behaving more like a volatile store of value than a pure speculative proxy. With another sharp intraday move on Friday, crypto stayed on traders’ radar as an indicator of shifting risk appetite.

## 2. How Major Asset Classes Reacted (1–5 Dec)

### **Equities**
- **S&P 500: +0.89%** — Stocks edged higher as markets positioned for a likely Fed cut, with sentiment supported by stabilizing inflation data.  
- **Nasdaq: +1.56%** — Tech outperformed as rate expectations eased, reducing pressure on growth valuations.  
- **EuroStoxx 100: +0.10% / CAC 40: +0.04%** — European equities were broadly flat as investors awaited clarity from the upcoming Fed meeting.

### **Rates / Bonds**
- **US 10Y: +3.04 bps** — Yields inched higher as bond markets priced uncertainty around Fed communication despite widespread expectations of a cut.  
- **German Bund 10Y: +3.14 bps** — European yields followed the U.S., reflecting global caution ahead of central bank meetings.

### **FX**
- **EUR/USD: +0.47%** — The euro strengthened modestly as the dollar softened on rising odds of U.S. monetary easing.  
- **DXY: –0.37%** — The dollar weakened as markets shifted toward risk assets and repriced the Fed’s upcoming decision.

### **Commodities**
- **Brent: +0.03%** — Oil was essentially unchanged, with weak demand signals balanced by positioning ahead of OPEC commentary.  
- **Gold: –0.13%** — Gold dipped slightly as higher yields and reduced volatility weighed on safe-haven demand.

## 3. Why It Matters for Next Week

### **1. The Fed meeting, Powell’s guidance, and the new dot plot will drive all markets**
Next week’s Fed meeting is the final and most contentious one of the year, with investors expecting a 25 bp cut but increasingly focused on how divided the Committee is. Powell’s press conference and the release of the new Summary of Economic Projections (the “dot plot”) will shape the rate outlook for 2026 and determine whether markets view the Fed as dovish or concerned about persistent inflation. With a reshuffling of voting members coming in January and speculation intensifying over Powell’s successor, communication risk will be exceptionally high.

### **2. Bond market stress raises questions about whether the Santa Claus rally can hold**
The 10-year yield jumped more than 10 bps this week, highlighting growing discomfort about the Fed’s longer-term trajectory. Even if the Fed cuts, a dovish tone could paradoxically send yields higher if investors perceive rising inflation risks or slower progress toward 2026 easing. This tension has put the recent rally in equities under scrutiny, with several strategists warning that a miscommunication from Powell could interrupt the typical year-end momentum.

### **3. Key labor data and major earnings (Oracle, Adobe, Broadcom, Costco) will shape sentiment**
Shutdown-delayed JOLTS data will give the market a clearer picture of hirings, layoffs, and quits, providing the first reliable read on labor-market tightening since the shutdown. At the same time, earnings from Oracle and Adobe will be closely watched for signals on cloud demand and AI investment returns, while Broadcom and Costco will offer insight into semiconductors and consumer spending. These releases arrive at a critical moment when the Fed is operating without complete data, raising their importance for market direction.

## 4. Article of the Week  

**Financial Times — “Donald Trump says he will nominate Federal Reserve chair in ‘early’ 2026”**  
This piece highlights the growing political uncertainty around the Fed, as Trump openly floats Kevin Hassett as a “potential” successor to Powell and signals a decision “early next year”. It underlines the risk that future US monetary policy could become more politicized, with markets already nervous about the balance between inflation control, growth and pressure from the White House. In the context of this week’s divided FOMC and sensitive communication, the article is key to understanding how the medium-term policy framework might shift.

**Bonus long read — Le Nouvel Économiste, “Entretien avec Philippe Aghion, prix Nobel d’économie”**  
Aghion reflects on innovation, creative destruction and Europe’s structural weaknesses in competition, industrial policy and AI. His defence of an “inclusive but innovative” growth model and his critique of barriers to competition and poorly designed wealth taxation offer a useful framework to think about current debates on big tech, AI investment and Europe’s lagging productivity — themes that sit behind many of this year’s market narratives.
