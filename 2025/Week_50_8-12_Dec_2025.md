## 1. What Moved Markets This Week

### **1. Fed expectations anchored market sentiment**
Markets were primarily driven by positioning around the Federal Reserve’s December policy decision. Equities traded in a narrow range as investors priced in a high probability (around 85–90%) of a 25bp rate cut. Softer inflation prints and mixed labour-market data reinforced this view. As a result, expectations around monetary easing became the dominant force shaping price action across equities, bonds, FX, and commodities, keeping volatility contained but conviction low.

### **2. The Netflix–Warner Bros deal reignited political and antitrust risk**
The announced acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery assets by Netflix turned into a market-moving event well beyond the media sector. Shortly after the $83bn cash-and-stock deal was made public, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile counter-bid, while Donald Trump publicly signalled potential involvement, citing antitrust concerns.

The size of the breakup fees—$2.8bn if Warner walks away, $5.8bn if regulators block the deal—highlighted the high regulatory and political risk embedded in large-scale M&A. Markets interpreted the situation as a reminder that U.S. antitrust risk is firmly back on the table, particularly for platform-scale acquisitions.

### **3. Tesla’s downgrade reinforced rotation away from high-expectation trades**
Tesla shares fell sharply after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock from overweight to equal-weight. While the bank acknowledged Tesla’s leadership in EVs, manufacturing, and real-world AI, it argued that expectations had moved closer to fair value.

The downgrade reflected growing concern over near-term risks, including potential earnings disappointments and slower momentum in the core EV business. The move reinforced a broader market theme: investors are becoming less willing to pay extreme premiums for future narratives in a still-restrictive rate environment.

## 2. How Major Asset Classes Reacted (8–12 Dec)

### **Equities**
- **S&P 500: −1.3%** — A controlled pullback as positioning adjusted ahead of the Fed.
- **Nasdaq: −1.55%** — Continued pressure on high-valuation tech and growth stocks as rate expectations and valuation discipline tightened.
- **EuroStoxx 100: −0.7% / CAC 40: −1.6%** — European equities underperformed modestly, with France more exposed to global risk sentiment.

### **Rates / Bonds**
- **US 10Y: higher on the week** — Yields edged up as markets reassessed the timing and pace of Fed easing.
- **German Bund 10Y: +3.14 bps** — European yields followed the U.S., reflecting global caution ahead of central bank meetings.
- **CBOE Volatility Index: +1.7%** — Volatility picked up modestly, signalling increased hedging demand amid rate and equity uncertainty.

### **FX**
- **EUR/USD: +1.2%** — The euro strengthened as softer U.S. data and easing Fed expectations weighed on the dollar.
- **DXY: −1.4%** — The dollar weakened sharply, reflecting growing conviction that Fed easing is approaching.

### **Commodities**
- **Brent: −4.3%** — Oil came under sustained pressure as weaker demand expectations outweighed geopolitical risk premiums.
- **Gold: +2.4%** — Gold rallied on a weaker dollar and falling real yields, benefiting from the easing narrative.

## 3. Why It Matters for Next Week

### **1. Policy expectations are fully priced**
Markets are entering next week with little margin for error. Expectations around Fed easing are now embedded in prices. Any upside surprise in inflation or renewed labour-market strength would force a rapid repricing across assets. The risk is asymmetric: disappointing data hurts more than supportive data helps.

### **2. Bonds will lead, equities will follow**
The real signal is coming from rates, not stocks. Elevated long-end yields continue to challenge the soft-landing narrative and equity valuations, particularly for long-duration growth assets. If real yields remain firm, equity narratives will struggle to hold.

### **3. Positioning, rotation, and the dollar remain key**
Sector leadership remains fragile. The rotation away from mega-cap tech and AI is not noise. If macro data reinforces a “higher-for-longer” outlook, defensives and value should continue to outperform while momentum trades unwind. At the same time, renewed dollar strength would tighten global financial conditions and weigh on risk assets.
